In December 2018, the revised Renewable Energy Directive established a new binding renewable energy target for the EU for 2030 of at least 32% of final energy consumption, with a clause for a possible upwards revision by 2023 and an increased 14% target for the share of renewable fuels in transport by 2030 [1].
As such, this project conducts an analysis on how these countriesâ€™ demographic, economic and environmental variables affect the Renewable energy consumption.

It was performed:

- K means Cluster
- Hierchical Cluster
- Multiple Linear Regression 
- Forecasting using a Moving Average (1) model
